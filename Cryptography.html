    <section>
      <p>
        Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it
        into a form that only intended recipients can process and read. Its
        first known use dates back to the year 1900 BC as hieroglyphics in an
        Egyptian tomb. The term itself comes from the Greek words kryptos and
        graphein, which mean hidden and to write, respectively. <br />
        <br />
        One of the most famous uses was developed by Julius Caesar around 40 BC
        and was aptly named Caesar’s cipher. A cipher uses a secret piece of
        information that tells you how to scramble and therefore unscramble a
        message. Caesar used a substitution cipher, where each letter of the
        alphabet was replaced by a letter in a different fixed position further
        up or down in the alphabet. For example, the alphabet could be moved
        five places to the right meaning the letter "A" would now be "F", "B"
        would now be "G" and so on. That meant he could pass along messages
        without fear of them being intercepted, because only his officers knew
        how to unscramble the message.<br />
        <br />
        Giovan Battista Bellaso, a 16th-century cryptologist, designed the
        Vigenere cipher (falsely attributed to diplomat Blaise de Vigenere),
        believed to be the first cipher that used an encryption key. The
        alphabet was written across 26 rows, with each row shifting a letter to
        create a grid. The encryption key was written out to match the length of
        the message. Then, the grid was used to encrypt the message, letter by
        letter. Finally, the sender shared the encrypted message and the secret
        keyword to the recipient, who would possess the same grid. <br />
        <br />
        Then along came computers, which enabled much more sophisticated
        cryptography. But the goal remains the same: to transfer a readable
        message (plain text) into something an unintended reader cannot
        understand (cipher text). The process is known as encryption and is how
        information can be shared across public internet connections. The
        knowledge about how to decrypt – or unscramble – the data is known as
        the key and only intended parties should have access to this
        information.
      </p>
      <h2>How does cryptography work?</h2>
      <p>
        There are many ways in which to encrypt information, and the levels of
        complexity depend on the degree of protection the data may require. But
        we commonly see three types of cryptographic algorithms.
      </p>
      <h2>Symmetric encryption</h2>
      <p>
        Symmetric encryption – or secret-key encryption – relies on a single
        key. This means that the sender and receiver of data both share the same
        key, which is then used both to encrypt and decrypt the information.<br />
        <br />
        To do that, the secret key needs to be agreed upon ahead of time. While
        still a good source of encryption, the fact that there is only a single
        key protecting the information means there is some risk when sending it
        over insecure connections. Just imagine you want to share your front
        door key with a friend by hiding it under your doormat. Your friend now
        has access to your house. But there is also a chance a stranger could
        find the key and enter without your permission.
      </p>

    <h2>Asymmetric encryption</h2>
    <p>
      Asymmetric encryption – or public-key encryption – uses a pair of keys.
      This added level of security instantly increases the protection of the
      data. In this case, each key serves a single purpose. There is a public
      key that can be exchanged with anybody, over any network. This key has the
      information on how to encrypt the data and anyone can use it. But there is
      also a private key. The private key is not shared and holds the
      information about how to decrypt the message. Both keys are generated by
      an algorithm that uses large prime numbers to create two unique,
      mathematically linked keys. Anyone with access to the public key can use
      it to encrypt a message, but only the private key holder can decipher the
      message. <br />
      <br />
      It works almost like a mailbox. Anyone can put a message into the deposit
      slot. But only the owner of the mailbox has the key to open it and read
      the messages. This is the foundation for most cryptocurrency transactions.
