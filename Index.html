      <p>
        Cryptocurrency is a relatively new type of money that operates in a
        completely different way than the traditional currency we all use every
        day. The most basic difference is that it’s exclusively a virtual
        currency, meaning there are no physical cryptocurrency coins or notes
        you can keep in your back pocket. <br />

        <br />

        It’s also issued, or created, in a unique way. Instead of being produced
        by a central bank or government, like U.S. dollars, euros and other fiat
        currencies are, new cryptocurrency units typically enter circulation
        through a technological process that involves the participation of
        volunteers from all over the world using their computers.That is why
        cryptocurrency is often described as “decentralized.” Cryptocurrencies
        are typically not controlled or operated by any single entity in any
        single country. It takes an entire network of volunteers from around the
        world to secure and validate transactions made with cryptocurrency.

        <strong>Regulation:</strong> The global financial system has been based
        on various fiat currencies for centuries and most countries have a
        mature set of laws and best practices to regulate their use.
        Cryptocurrency, however, is a largely unregulated market, and even when
        regulations exist they can vary by jurisdiction
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <strong>Supply:</strong>Fiat money has an unlimited supply. That means
        governments and central banks are free to print new currency at will
        during times of financial crisis. Cryptocurrencies, however, usually
        have a predictable supply determined by an algorithm. Many
        cryptocurrencies are coded to include a supply limit (though some
        don’t). For example, bitcoin – the world’s first cryptocurrency and the
        largest by market capitalization – has a maximum supply of 21 million
        tokens that are released at a steady and predictable rate. That means
        once the number of bitcoin in circulation reaches 21 million, the
        protocol will cease releasing new coins into circulation.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <strong>Speed and cost:</strong>Sending and completing cross-border
        transactions using cryptocurrency is much faster than using the legacy
        banking system. Instead of taking several business days, transactions
        can occur within minutes, often at a fraction of the cost, when compared
        with using fiat currency.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>Immutable:</strong>Unlike transactions involving fiat
        currencies, all completed crypto transactions are permanent and final.
        It is virtually impossible to reverse crypto transactions once they have
        been added to the ledger.

      <p>
        The word “crypto” in cryptocurrency refers to the special system of
        encrypting and decrypting information – known as cryptography – which is
        used to secure all transactions sent between users. Cryptography plays a
        vitally important role in allowing users to freely transact tokens and
        coins between one another without the need for an intermediary like a
        bank to keep track of each person’s balance and ensure the network
        remains secure. <br />
        <br />
        It also solves a problem that used to make middlemen like banks
        indispensable – the double-spend issue: when a person attempts to spend
        the same balance twice with two different parties.<br />
        <br />
        Cryptocurrencies use cryptography to encrypt sensitive information,
        including the private keys – long alphanumeric strings of characters –
        of crypto holders. Think of private keys as the passwords that determine
        the ownership of cryptocurrencies. Keep in mind that cryptocurrencies
        cannot be stored outside of the blockchain. They are permanently based
        on the blockchain. Hence, when someone says they own X amount of coins,
        what they really mean is that their password can legitimately claim X
        amount of coins on the blockchain.
